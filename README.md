# High-resolution networks (HRNets) for Image classification

## Introduction
This is the official code of [high-resolution representations for ImageNet classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04514). 
We augment the HRNet with a classification head shown in the figure below. First, the four-resolution feature maps are fed into a bottleneck and the number of output channels are increased to 128, 256, 512, and 1024, respectively. Then, we downsample the high-resolution representations by a 2-strided 3x3 convolution outputting 256 channels and add them to the representations of the second-high-resolution representations. This process is repeated two times to get 1024 channels over the small resolution. Last, we transform 1024 channels to 2048 channels through a 1x1 convolution, followed by a global average pooling operation. The output 2048-dimensional representation is fed into the classifier.

## Quick start
### Install
1. Install PyTorch=0.4.1 following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/)
2. git clone https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Image-Classification
3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data preparation
You can follow the Pytorch implementation:
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet

The data should be under ./data/imagenet/images/.

### Train and test
Please specify the configuration file.

For example, train the HRNet-W18 on ImageNet with a batch size of 128 on 4 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/train.py --cfg experiments/cls_hrnet_w18_sgd_lr5e-2_wd1e-4_bs32_x100.yaml
````

For example, test the HRNet-W18 on ImageNet on 4 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/valid.py --cfg experiments/cls_hrnet_w18_sgd_lr5e-2_wd1e-4_bs32_x100.yaml --testModel hrnetv2_w18_imagenet_pretrained.pth
````
